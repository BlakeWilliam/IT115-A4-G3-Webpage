        <p>What can you do to help support your favorite local businesses? Whether it is a restaurant you love, a small record shop in your neighborhood, or the that bookstore that has resident cats that you can't bear thinking of letting slip away. We have a few tips to help out local businesses to make it through these trying times.</p>
        
        <h3>Buy a gift card or gift certificate</h3>
        <p>A lot of businesses are already struggling with a downturn in demad and visits. If you have the means to buy a gift card/certificate at your favorite place - even if just for future use - do it! Giving the business a little boost to their already slowing sales could help make a hard month a little less so.</p>
        <h3>Consider getting a gift/essential from somewhere near you instead of ording it online</h3>
        <p>If you are already in the market for a gift or that replacment of your monthly coffee bean stock, think about places in your neighborhood that has those items. The little indie shop near you might have something perfect for a gift and that local roaster definitely has better quality beans than most big online retailers. The little guys might just have something for you faster than the one/two day shipping if you know what you want.</p>
        <h3>Order take out directly from the restaurant</h3>
        <p>Many restaurants are now offering take out and delivery options. If its somewhere you're able to pick it up yourself, call the restaurant or their website. Many have online options or take phone orders for pick up. While many restaurants are also on delivery apps - use them for places that are otherwise not accessible by you. Remember that restaurants - even though they providing the goods - that favorite delivery app will charge the restaurant a fee for the order and any tip you leave does not get to the restaurant, that is for the driver. Tips for drivers are needed too - but don't be mistaken that the restaurant benefits from that. </p>
        <h3>Engage them on social media</h3>
        <p>Many small businesses rely on social media like Instagram or Twitter to interact with their customers. If you miss them - let them know. Want to k now what you can do to support them specifically? Hit them up! Almost all business have a unique offer and ways to support them. It's all about asking or following their feeds. They miss you just as much!  </p>
