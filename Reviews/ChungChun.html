            <!--ADD REVIEW HERE-->
        <div class="review"> Not only can this place be considered a spot for the next Instagram food trend, but ChungChun's corn dogs are already a street food trend worldwide. ChungChun is a Korean streed food chain that is the first to make an appearance in the Pacific Northwest. Located on King Street in Chinatown-International District, the restaurant have a many different corn dogs adorned with eye-catching toppings that can be mixed and matcheed to create your own culinary piece. Crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside, servers carefully roll hot dogs or mozzarella cheese sticks in a thick rice flour batter (squid ink can be added for a black-tinted specialty) and deep-fry them on the spot. The plain version is topped with panko breadcrumbs, but sweet potato chunks and ramen add an extra crunchy texture. Though the restaurant is pretty small, which requires you to pop in and out for your food, I see it as part of a city street food vibe to stand along the sidewalk and enjoy a small treat! </div>
