        <div class="review"> This restaurant was probably my most visited restaurant ever. Visually, this is the restaurant that fits the description “No Frills”. If you are a new customer, it’s very likely that the service you got was subpar in comparison to might be considered the norm - until you become a regular. Once they recognized me, they were like family. The ambiance - the lighting was not the most pleasant, with low volume radio set to popular hits from the 90s onward, and the decor wasn’t anything to rave about. What made this place special for me was the fairly priced, authentic (tolerably) dishes and the nostalgic feel of the old Seattle reminiscence. Hana’s served as a dining place of choice to many of the surrounding residents and students since their advent in 1992.</div>
