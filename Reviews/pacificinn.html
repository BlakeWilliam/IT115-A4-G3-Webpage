            <!--ADD REVIEW HERE-->
        <div class="review">Another Seattle classic, Pacific Inn Pub is located in a low key neighborhood right on Lake Union and Burke Gilman trail. Great food & tap beer selections and somewhat of a dive, this place is a great place to fill both your thirst and hunger and also a low-key hideout. I have definitely had a few solo drinking sittings, casual meetings, secret dates and alike. They even have an outdoor deck for those few sunny days we have here in Seattle. I love their dim-lit lighting, the staff are not too friendly, not too rude. They pretty much just leave you alone, unless you need something. Really, nothing fancy, but that old school Seattle vibe. The prices seem to be normal, perhaps they have adjusted per recent growth, but definitely not by much. This is definitely one of my favorite places to stop by once in a while, always a good time there.</div>
