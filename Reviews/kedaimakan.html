        <div class="review"> Starting out in as a humble food cart at farmer's markets, to a walk up, take out window affiliated with the bar Montana next door, Kedai Makan now has a full restaurant space just around the corner. This Capitol Hill staple has taken it's small beginnings and made created a space that invites people to fully embrace its Malaysian flavors. Cool teal, and warm oranges and reds pop against the warm wood details. Glass jars of house-made herbal tinctures sit above the bar waiting for you to sample whats inside. The place is usually packed with a waiting list for dinner just about everyday. There is a lively buzz that hangs in the air - It's exciting and alive.<br><br> Kevin and Alison have adapted their small food cart menu and expanded it to fit the restaurant crowd. Their staple Nasi Goreng Kedai is a signature. Malaysian style fried rice - fragrant and savory, is cooked with indonesian sweet soy, tofu, sprouts, greens and topped with a fried runny egg. This can stand on its own, its absolutely hearty and satisfying. If your not familiar with Malaysian flavors, I definitely suggest starting there. My personal favorite is the Mushroom Pan Mee. House made hand cut noodles cooked to perfection - served with mushrooms, green onions, fried shallots, crunchy fried anchovy and poached egg. They also serve this with a side of their mushroom broth suggested to be sipped on with the meal. But I am a rule breaker. Pour some if it into the noodles and mix it up for a saucier version I can only describe as perfect.<br><br>Their cocktails are all imaginative: some asian-style takes on some classic drinks and some original creatioons. Try the #Cocolife with rum, coconut cream, lime, house curry powder, and pineapple. Its a beast to compliment the sweet, savory, and spicy food you are eating.<br><br>This place has been a favorite of mine since the food cart days back in the early 2010's. I cannot stress how good the food is. They keep it simple - and always have an ever-changing special worth trying. The food quality, frienliness of the staff, and absolute consistency across the board make this place a must try!</div>
